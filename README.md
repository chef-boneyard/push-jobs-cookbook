# push-jobs cookbook

Installs the Opscode Push Jobs client package and sets it up to run as
a service.

The official documentation is on
[docs.opscode.com](http://docs.opscode.com/pushy.html)

# Requirements

Requires Opscode Enterprise Chef with the Push
Jobs feature.

* Chef: 11.4.0 or higher
* runit cookbook

## Platform

* Debian
* Ubuntu
* Windows

Tested on Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04, CentOS 6.4, and Windows 2008
R2. It may work on other debian, rhel, or windows platform families with or
without modification.

Testing for Ubuntu/CentOS can be done with Test Kitchen, see TESTING.md in this repository.

# Usage

Set the appropriate attributes and include the default recipe in a
node's run list.

In order for the push jobs to be used, a whitelist of job names and
their commands must be set in the configuration file. This is
automatically generated from the attribute
`node['push_jobs']['whitelist']`. For example:

    node.set['push_jobs']['whitelist'] = {
      "chef-client" => "chef-client",
      "apt-get-update" => "apt-get update"
    }

As this is an attribute, interesting uses arise from orchestrating a
Chef Client run. Assuming the above is present on the node prior to
running the recipe, run Chef Client with this command from the local
workstation:

    knife job start chef-client A_NODE_NAME

New jobs can be added to the whitelist simply by creating attributes.
This can be done with `knife exec`:

    knife exec -E 'nodes.transform("name:A_NODE_NAME") do |n|
      n.set["push_jobs"]["whitelist"]["ntpdate"] = "ntpdate -u time"
    end'

Then, run the chef-client job, and then the ntpdate job:

    knife job start chef-client A_NODE_NAME
    knife job start ntpdate A_NODE_NAME

In a future release, an LWRP may be added to automatically add push
jobs.

# Attributes

Attributes are documented in metadata.rb. See `attributes/default.rb`
for default values.

# Recipes

## default

The default recipe includes the appropriate recipe based on the node's
`platform_family`.

## linux

The `node['push_jobs']['package_url']` attribute must be set for this
recipe to download the Opscode Push Jobs Client package from the URL.

The recipe will write out the whitelist of
jobs as a separate configuration file.

It will also set up the Opscode Push Jobs Client daemon as a service
using `runit`. The default logger is used, so the log will be
`/var/log/push-jobs-client/current`.

## knife

If the `node['push_jobs']['gem_url']` attribute is set, this
recipe will download the knife-pushy gem to the system.

Use this recipe on workstation systems that should manage running jobs
with the knife plugin.

## windows

The `node['push_jobs']['package_url']` attribute must be set
to use this recipe, as Windows does not have the concept of a package
manager with remote repositories. The URL will be used (with the
checksum attribute) to install the package using the `windows_package`
resource from the `windows` cookbook.

The recipe will write out the whitelist of
jobs as a separate configuration file.

The client service will be enabled and started.
